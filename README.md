This repository severs as store of the progress of a 2D game development course I'm following by Dylan Falconer. While I've been experimenting on my own by remaking arcade classics, I always find it useful to see how others handle the same set of problems that I came across. I look forward to following along on a weekly basis, and continuing my journey of learning game development.

Let's have some fun!
